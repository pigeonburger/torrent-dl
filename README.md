## Description

Torrent-DL is an efficient command-line program allowing you to quickly download files via the Bittorrent protocol.

It is built using [`node.js`](https://github.com/nodejs/node), but does not require it to be installed on your computer if you download it from the [releases](https://github.com/pigeonburger/torrent-dl/releases/latest/) page.

The `torrent-dl` binaries are all approximately 35MB in size, as they come pre-bundled with a small `node.js` runtime so they can run on any computer.

---

## Installation

Windows users can download the latest `torrent-dl` release from [here](https://github.com/pigeonburger/torrent-dl/releases/latest/download/torrent-dl-windows-x64) and place it anywhere in their system [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_%28variable%29) except for `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32` (e.g. do not put in `C:\Windows\System32`).

To install right away for Linux users:

```
sudo curl -L https://github.com/pigeonburger/torrent-dl/releases/latest/download/torrent-dl-linux-x64 -o /usr/local/bin/torrent-dl
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/torrent-dl
```

To install right away for MacOS users:

```
sudo curl -L https://github.com/pigeonburger/torrent-dl/releases/latest/download/torrent-dl-macos-x64 -o /usr/local/bin/torrent-dl
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/torrent-dl
```

If you *do* have `node.js` and `npm` installed on your device, then feel free to install it with:

```
npm install -g torrent-dl
```
(requires `node.js` v12 or higher)

## Usage

```
torrent-dl -i [MAGNET LINK OR TORRENT FILE] [OPTIONS]
```

At the very basic level, the only option you need to provide is `-i`, e.g:

```
torrent-dl -i magnet:?xt=urn:btih:b26c81363ac1a236765385a702aec107a49581b5
```

This command will start downloading the Ubuntu 20.04 Desktop ISO.

You can also just pass the torrent's infohash:

```
torrent-dl -i b26c81363ac1a236765385a702aec107a49581b5
```

You are also able to provide the path to a downloaded torrent file, e.g:

```
torrent-dl -i /path/to/torrent-file.torrent
```

You can also provide a *link* to a torrent without having to download it:

```
torrent-dl -i https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent
```

More options available for use are below.

---

## Options


### `-i, --input`
Magnet link, infohash, torrent file or link to torrent file [REQUIRED]

This option can be used more than once to specify multiple references to torrents (they do not all need to be of the same type), e.g. `-i torrent1.torrent -i magnetlink -i https://example.com/anothertorrent.torrent`

Alternatively, you can also reference a `.txt` file containing a torrent reference on each line. Take this file, `torrents.txt` for example:

```
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:873dd05bd69f2626e4123887e7bb7922aaeb4efa&dn=873dd05bd69f2626e4123887e7bb7922aaeb4efa
https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/ubuntu-20.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent
magnet:?xt=urn:btih:0aae223b7c0244e4952158554cd0506f0eca1fdf&dn=archlinux-2021.09.01-x86_64.iso
```

This file has the magnet link to a Linux Mint ISO on one line, Ubuntu on another line, and Arch Linux on the last line.

You can pass `torrents.txt` to `torrent-dl` like so:

```
torrent-dl -i torrents.txt
```

This will download all 3 torrents in the `txt` file, one after another.

The file you specify **must** have a `.txt` extension.

### `-p, --port`
Port to listen for incoming peers [Default is 6881]

### `-c, --connections`
Maximum number of peers to connect to [Default is 100]

### `-u, --uploadslots`
Number of upload slots [Default is 10]

### `-s, --search`
Download a torrent from a popular torrent site with a search query.

Use this option to specify a supported torrent site (see supported sites below), and then `-i` will be interpeted as the search query.

Available sites:

- `tpb` - The Pirate Bay
- `ia` - Internet Archive

**While there are legimate, legal torrents on these sites, you should always take caution and ensure it can actually *legally be downloaded* in this way (see this notice [here](#other-notices) also). Legal penalties may apply.**

Example usage:

```
torrent-dl --search tpb -i "ubuntu desktop"
```

You will then be presented with the first search result, and can navigate through all other results that come up, review their details and then download from one of them.

You can also specify multiple search terms by using `-i` more than once, or creating a `.txt` file and specifying a search term on each new line. (Please note that this will require you to manually select a search result for each one)

### `-t, --tracker`
Manually add a custom tracker URL (can be used more than once if adding multiple trackers)

### `-v, --verbose`
Prints extra informational output (such as data about connected peers)

### `-h, --help`
Show the help menu.

### `--version`
Print the `torrent-dl` version number.

## Troubleshooting

### I'm stuck on "Fetching files....." or "0 peers"
A number of factors could have caused this

- The torrent may have 0 seeders, meaning the file cannot currently be downloaded ðŸ˜¬ sorry to be the bearer of bad news if this is the case. You can leave `torrent-dl` running like that and if a seeder ever pops up again, it will start downloading it.

- Some ISPs block commonly used torrenting ports like 6881 - try switching to a different, larger port number. e.g. `--port 43022`

- ISPs can also block P2P communication altogether, if this is the case for you, use a VPN.

### My download speed is really slow
Your download speed can only be as fast as the combined upload speeds of all peers you're connected to, and this can vary depending on the torrent. Often, the more peers you're connected to, the faster you'll be able to download the files.

You can increase the maximum number of peers you can connect to with the `-c` option, e.g. `-c 250`

---

## To-Do List

- ~~Add support for passing a `.txt` file containing a list of multiple torrents.~~ Done.
- Proxy support.
- Configuration file support.
- Add automatic search and download functionality for popular torrent sites.
- Make `--verbose` output look less stupid.
- Asynchronous multiple downloads(?)
